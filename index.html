								<h2 class="major">Career</h2>
								<p>Over the years with Progress Rail, I have held several roles:</p>
								<p>I began as an account executive, and quickly progressed to the role of class one account executive where I utilized analytical skills to develop and implement reporting tools. My success in simplifying day-to-day operations garnered attention from the IT department, who later approached me to assist with companywide reporting requests.</p>
								<p>Within IT, I gained valuable exposure to departments globally within the organization, including Finance, HR, Quality, Safety, Procurement, Warehousing, Production, and Sales. I also gained significant experience working with various enterprise systems such as D365, SAP, and Infor LN.</p>
								<p>Today, I serve as team lead for Power BI report development. In this capacity, I am responsible for managing the team's workflow and ensuring that requests are completed to full specifications. Additionally, I am part responsible for managing the enterprise's master data, ensuring quality and accuracy of our data across multiple systems.</p>

								<h3>Favorite Reads of 2023...so far</h3>
								<h4>Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by Atul Gawande</h4>
								<p>Gawande covers great topics about end of life and how extraordinary measures near the end of life often do more harm than good. Instead of focusing on happiness in the final years of an illness or old age, people consume endless treatments and trials in an attempt to prolong life. By refocusing and considering quality over quantity, people can instead enjoy the last few years with their loved ones.</p>
								<h4>What My Bones Know by Stephanie Foo</h4>
								<p>This memoir explores abuse, intergenerational trauma, and self-acceptance. Foo explores the journey through learning to move forward in spite of her experienced abuse in childhood. She discovers that the way that she was raised stemmed from her parents also experiencing a lot of tough situations. In order to move forward, we all have to do some form of work in forgiving and learning about ourselves.</p>
								<p>Even though I don't believe I have experienced traumatic events in life, there are habits and perceptions that were passed down and learned from my parents.</p>
